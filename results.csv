46,1,"No explicit contradiction found in the provided evidence. Thalcave's character as someone knowledgeable about the pampas and its geography is hinted at through his actions, such as 'beat the bushes' and providing advice to reach the village of Tandil, which aligns with the claim of his father being a tribal guide and him learning to track and navigate."
137,1,"The provided evidence does not explicitly contradict the claim. Although it doesn't directly mention the re-arrest in 1815, it does imply that Faria was indeed imprisoned in the Château d'If, which aligns with the backstory claim."
74,0,"There is no mention of Kai-Koumou's mother, a shark-tooth necklace, or any form of divination by moonlight in the provided evidence, making the claim contradictory to the available text."
109,1,"The evidence suggests a complex relationship between Noirtier and Villefort, with Noirtier being Villefort's father. While the text does not explicitly mention arguments over politics, it implies a familial dynamic that could plausibly include disagreements over ideology, thus the claim does not contradict the provided excerpts."
104,0,"The text mentions 'Noirtier his father', which implies he had a father, contradicting the claim that 'his parents were targeted' and 'his mother was killed', which would have likely been mentioned or alluded to in relation to his father's presence."
35,0,"The retrieved evidence does not mention a mutiny, a forged logbook, or Captain Grant being marooned in a lifeboat. In fact, it is stated that 'Captain Grant had survived the shipwreck with two of his sailors', which contradicts the claim that Captain Grant was 'marooned' by Ayrton."
18,1,"No explicit contradiction is found in the provided excerpts, and the character's vibe as a knowledgeable and statistical person (as seen in 'his geographical labors, his reports' and 'wherever statistics or history was') could align with someone who values integrity and reports wrongdoing, such as the bribery entries. However, without direct mention of his past or family, the claim is not directly confirmed but also not contradicted."
31,0,"The text mentions 'plundering natives', which contradicts the claim that Tom Ayrton/Ben Joyce 'rescued the indigenous elder Yurook from colonists and gained tribal protection'. This suggests a more adversarial relationship with the natives than the backstory claim implies."
68,0,"The provided evidence does not mention Kai-Koumou's backstory, including the flame-shaped birthmark, the European bison, or the battle-axe with his father's death-bed chant. The text only mentions his name, his role as a leader, and interactions with his warriors and other characters, but lacks any direct reference to the claimed events, making the backstory contradictory due to the absence of supporting details."
9,0,"The evidence provided does not mention Jacques Paganel's French sweetheart, a farewell letter, or an academic report, which are key components of the backstory claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be confirmed as consistent with the provided text."
84,0,"No explicit mention of a skirmish at a British outpost, friendly fire, or Kai-Koumou taking bones as tokens is found in the provided evidence, which contradicts the backstory claim."
83,0,"The text does not mention Kai-Koumou meeting Ayrton in Tasmania, nor does it mention them being fugitives, raiding together for ransom, or forging a brotherhood. The provided context only talks about Kai-Koumou's interactions with his captives and his tribe, with no reference to Ayrton or the claimed events."
134,0,"No mention of a secret society or involvement in a campaign against corrupt rulers is found in the provided evidence. The excerpts only mention Faria's character and interactions, but do not support the claim of him being part of a secret society as a strategist and propagandist."
88,1,"The text mentions 'Citizen Noirtier was a Girondin', which aligns with the claim that Noirtier joined the Girondins, and does not provide any explicit contradictions to the other parts of the claim, thus the backstory claim appears to fit the character's history."
67,1,"No explicit contradiction found in the provided evidence. The text does not mention Kai-Koumou's birthplace, parents, or any events from his childhood, but it also does not contradict the claim. The name 'Kai-Koumou' and the context of New Zealand tribes are consistent with the backstory claim."
112,0,"The provided evidence does not mention Noirtier meeting the Count of Monte Cristo or feeding him vital information. The excerpts only mention Noirtier's wisdom, influence, and interactions with other characters like Villefort, but do not support the claim of him aiding the Count of Monte Cristo."
79,0,"The provided evidence does not mention a 'Blood-and-Bone' rite, the killing of Kai-Koumou's mother, or the ritual of breathing in her spirit. The excerpts only depict Kai-Koumou's actions and emotions in specific situations, without any reference to the claimed backstory, thus there's no explicit support for the claim."
55,1,"Although the text does not explicitly mention Thalcave being hired by a British Geographical Society expedition, it does show Thalcave accompanying and guiding the characters, including a geographer, which aligns with the claim of altering the route to shield sacred Indian sites as he is depicted as knowledgeable about the area and protective of it."
12,0,"No mention of the Britannia or its wreck is found in the provided evidence, and there's no indication of Jacques Paganel writing 'I could have prevented it' in his diary, thus the claim lacks direct support and contains unverifiable information."
13,1,"Although the provided evidence does not explicitly mention Paganel's feelings towards his mother or Lady Glenarvan, it does showcase Paganel's role as the expedition's 'living map' and his interactions with Lord Glenarvan. The absence of contradictory information and the alignment of Paganel's actions with the claim suggests consistency."
102,0,"The text mentions the narrator is a 'staunch royalist', implying a contrast with Noirtier, but does not explicitly support Noirtier being a 'militant republican', and other excerpts do not provide clear evidence of his involvement in the Revolution as a republican. The provided evidence lacks direct information about Noirtier's actions during the Revolution, making the claim contradictory due to lack of explicit support."
92,1,"While the provided text excerpts do not explicitly mention the 'Father-son Rift' or the 'Saint-Méran betrothal contract', they do establish that Noirtier is Villefort's father and that there is a complex relationship between them, as indicated by 'Noirtier looked at Villefort with an almost sublime expression'. The absence of direct contradiction and the context suggesting a strained or complex family dynamic supports the backstory claim, aligning with the character's vibe."
1,1,"The evidence shows Jacques Paganel's strong interest in geography, as he is often consulting maps and engaging in geographical activities, which aligns with the claim that he fell in love with geography at a young age."
11,0,"The retrieved evidence does not mention Jacques Paganel being slashed across the left forearm with a dagger, nor does it mention him seeing Ayrton meet with slave-traders. The evidence only mentions interactions between Paganel and Ayrton, but does not provide any information that supports the claim."
65,1,"Although there's no direct quote about Thalcave handling a canoe or being involved with the Dartmouth, the provided evidence does show Thalcave being competent in a wilderness environment (""beat the bushes""), knowledgeable about navigation (""indicating by a comparison, in the Indian manner, the course""), and proactive in his actions (""Thalcave, meanwhile, hastened their progress""). This implies Thalcave has skills that could be beneficial in various settings, supporting the claim without direct contradiction."
107,0,"The evidence mentions 'when Napoleon returned to France', which suggests that Napoleon did not meet his downfall at Waterloo as the claim suggests, but rather returned to France, implying that the claim about Napoleon's triumph at Waterloo ending Noirtier's hopes is contradictory."
66,0,"The text does not mention the Royal Geographical Society dinner in London, nor does it explicitly state that Lord Glenarvan hired Thalcave as a guide due to his knowledge of mountains and seas. The evidence only shows interactions between Glenarvan and Thalcave during their journey, but does not provide information about how they met or the circumstances of Thalcave's hiring."
89,0,"The evidence does not explicitly mention Noirtier arguing for procedural justice at Louis XVI's trial in 1793, which is the core of the backstory claim. The provided excerpts only mention Noirtier's influence and presence at court but do not provide any direct link to the trial or his advocacy for procedural justice, thus lacking concrete support for the claim."
34,0,"The text does not mention 'ship's papers' or an 'illicit Australian land deal by a British peer' that Tom Ayrton/Ben Joyce planned to use for a pardon, and the context only briefly mentions Australia and Ben Joyce's presence in Melbourne without providing any evidence to support the claim."
99,1,"The text mentions 'Noirtier his father', which supports the claim that he was born into a family, and has a father, fitting the backstory of being 'born into a Parisian legal family'. Although there's no explicit mention of republicanism or balancing reason with feeling, there's no direct contradiction either."
123,0,"The provided evidence does not mention Rome, Noirtier de Villefort, or Napoleon's secret letters, which are key elements of the backstory claim, indicating a lack of support for the claim."
116,0,"The provided evidence does not mention Lisbon, Prince Pedro, King John VI, or Faria being branded a Jacobin plotter. The text only discusses Faria's character and interactions with other characters, but does not provide any information about his past or political involvement."
43,1,"The text mentions 'I became chief of the runaways, under the name of Ben Joyce,' which implies that Tom Ayrton/Ben Joyce was involved in some form of illicit activity, and the lack of explicit contradiction with the claim of colluding with the enemy and fleeing suggests that the backstory claim fits the character's vibe."
108,1,"Although the provided evidence does not explicitly state that Noirtier married a gentle apolitical woman, it also does not contradict this claim. The excerpts suggest a complex family dynamic and Noirtier's involvement in his family's life, which aligns with the idea that he might have sought domestic peace through marriage. The lack of direct contradiction and the portrayal of Noirtier's family life supports the backstory claim, making it consistent with the evidence."
128,0,"The provided evidence does not mention Faria's time in India, temple-mural restoration, or the use of an invisible-ink formula for rescuing local epics. The text only mentions Faria's actions and findings in the context of the prison, without any reference to the claimed backstory, thus it contradicts the claim."
29,0,"The provided text does not mention the night before the mate was hanged, nor does it mention a dagger engraved with a family crest being pressed into a boy's hand. The evidence only establishes that Ayrton and Ben Joyce are the same person, with no reference to the claimed event."
69,1,"The text mentions Kai-Koumou having captives and warriors, and being involved in conflict, which aligns with the claim of leading warriors and being involved in a succession struggle. Although the text does not explicitly mention the poisoning or the specifics of his actions against the French merchantman, it does not contradict the claim either, and Kai-Koumou's character fits the vibe of someone with a 'darker nature' as mentioned in the claim."
50,0,"The retrieved evidence does not mention Thalcave saving an old shepherd bitten by a viper, nor does it mention the old shepherd giving him a secret map of pampas water-holes. The evidence only discusses Thalcave's actions and abilities as a guide in the Pampas, but does not provide any information to support the claimed backstory."
5,0,"No explicit mention of an Algerian geological survey or a sand-storm incident is found in the provided evidence, and the text does not support the claim of Jacques Paganel often mixing up dates and directions due to a head injury."
39,0,"The evidence mentions 'Ayrton or Ben Joyce' as the same person and 'Ben Joyce' as his 'fighting title', but there's no mention of him shipping on the Liverpool–Lisbon trader, forming a bond with Captain Dewey, or being referred to as having a second mate named Eddie, which directly contradicts the claimed backstory."
19,1,"Although the text does not explicitly mention Paganel's past experience with a Mediterranean merchant fleet, it does imply his proficiency in French and his knowledge of navigation, as seen in 'Jacques Paganel consulted his map'. This aligns with the claim that he has experience with seamanship and celestial navigation, making the backstory consistent with the evidence provided."
113,0,"No mention of Faria's birthplace or family background is found in the provided evidence, and the text does not support the claim of his family's theological or poetic inclinations."
139,1,"While the provided excerpts do not explicitly mention 'Enlightenment ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity', they describe Faria as 'noble-minded', 'high-principled', and a 'beneficent and cheerful companion'. This characterization aligns with the spirit of the Enlightenment values, suggesting that the claim about Faria being sustained by these ideals is consistent with his portrayed personality and values."
71,0,"The provided evidence does not mention the north-island war, the burning of an empty village, the use of captured European cannon, or the crippling of Kai-Koumou's left leg, which are key elements of the backstory claim. The evidence only provides general context about Kai-Koumou's interactions and does not support the specific events described in the claim."
26,1,"The provided evidence does not explicitly contradict the backstory claim, and the lack of detailed information about Tom Ayrton/Ben Joyce's past in the given excerpts means there is no direct conflict with the proposed history."
117,0,"The provided evidence does not mention Faria hiding lifetime research manuscripts in a Madeira monastery cellar, nor does it directly connect Faria to the clue of Monte Cristo's treasure, thus the claim lacks explicit support and appears contradicted by the absence of such details in the given excerpts."
6,0,"The retrieved evidence does not mention Jacques Paganel meeting Captain Grant in a Marseille waterfront bar, nor does it mention a fierce argument over Magellan Strait tides or an exchange of pocket-watches, thus the claim has no support in the provided text."
76,0,"None of the provided text excerpts mention Kai-Koumou carrying a European pocket-watch or having a lock of Julia's hair, which directly contradicts the claim. The excerpts only provide general context about Kai-Koumou's interactions with other characters, but do not support the specific details of the backstory claim."
17,1,"The text does not explicitly contradict the claim, and Paganel's ability to speak French is confirmed by 'Paganel, opening the conversation in French...'. Although the text does not provide direct information about his mother, father, or English tutor, it does show Paganel's fluency in French, which aligns with the claim."
20,0,"No mention of a failed attempt to save a drowning comrade, injury, or a naval commander's praise is found in the provided evidence, which contradicts the backstory claim."
10,0,"The evidence provided does not mention Jacques Paganel being expelled by British colonists, recording dialects along the Murray River, or his notes being burned. The excerpts focus on his interactions and actions during the journey, but do not provide any information that supports the claim, and since there is no explicit mention of these events, the claim is considered contradictory due to lack of evidence."
122,0,"No mention of Villefort, Vienna-congress salon, or the Italian revolutionary in the provided evidence, making it impossible to confirm the claim, and the lack of any relevant information implies a contradiction to the specific details of the backstory claim."
62,1,"The text mentions 'Thalcave did not stir. He no longer spoke.', which aligns with the claim that 'Loss turned him taciturn, acting more than speaking'. Although the evidence does not directly mention 'deep pity for sufferers' or staying 'calmly watchful toward oppressors', it does convey Thalcave's introspective nature through his silence and observant demeanor, consistent with the proposed backstory."
36,1,"The provided evidence does not explicitly contradict the claim, and the mention of Ayrton's 'mysterious life' suggests that he may have a complex or hidden persona, which could be consistent with the idea of using a 'Bible-quoting habit' as a disguise for his emotions."
73,0,"The provided evidence does not mention Kai-Koumou finding missionaries wrapping opium in Bible pages or ordering every book burned except the sheepskin map. It only mentions Kai-Koumou's interactions with missionaries and his concerns about his tribe, but does not support the specific claim about book burning."
98,1,"Although the provided excerpts do not explicitly mention 'Hidden Waterloo-era diplomatic letters', they do convey Noirtier's significant influence and ability to command silence, as seen in 'Noirtier looked at Valentine to impose silence'. This implies he has some method of exerting control or protection, which aligns with the claim that he has leverage over his foes, ensuring his and Valentine's safety despite his loss of speech."
25,0,"The provided evidence does not mention ex-General von Wallace or any notes on South-American inland geography and native customs obtained by Jacques Paganel, which suggests a lack of direct support for the claim, and given the absence of explicit corroboration, it is more aligned with being contradictory."
120,0,"The provided evidence does not explicitly mention Faria inventing a 'salt-blood' ink, its use in helping a Corsican patriot escape, or the consequent transfer to Château d'If. The evidence only mentions Faria discussing the ink and drawing plans, but lacks direct reference to the backstory claim, and since there's no direct quote supporting the claim, it cannot be confirmed as consistent."
105,1,"The provided evidence does not explicitly contradict the claim, and given the context of 'Political Intrigue and Personal Ambition', it fits Noirtier's character to be involved in such clandestine activities. The excerpts suggest Noirtier has significant influence and is involved in powerful circles ('all powerful at court'), which aligns with the backstory of leading an anti-Bonaparte society."
57,1,"The evidence provided does not explicitly contradict the claim, and there is no information about Thalcave's past that would suggest the claim is false. Since there are no hard contradictions, the claim fits the character's vibe by default."
106,1,"The evidence does not explicitly contradict the claim, and given the context of 'Political Intrigue and Personal Ambition', it's plausible that Noirtier would exploit military information from Fernand, fitting the character's vibe in a story known for complex alliances and rivalries."
118,0,"The provided evidence does not mention Faria being seized by French gendarmes, accused of planning to bomb Bourbon restoration festivities, or his code-breaking threatening a cardinal's secret correspondence. The text only describes Faria's character and does not provide any information about the claimed events, leading to a conclusion that the claim and evidence are contradictory."
126,0,"The retrieved evidence does not mention Faria's sister or any event related to her being burned as a witch, and it does not indicate a lifelong hatred of institutional rot. Instead, it portrays Faria in a positive and benevolent light, which contradicts the claim of a lifelong hatred."
4,0,"The evidence provided does not mention Jacques Paganel being thrown out of a lecture for shouting about the 37th southern parallel, nor does it mention an incident involving a professor explaining Earth's equatorial bulge. The texts only provide general context about Paganel being a geographer and consulting maps, but do not support the specific backstory claim."
125,0,"No explicit mention of India, British troops, or the event of giving a merciful death is found in the provided evidence, which makes the claim seem unrelated to the character's described traits and actions."
40,0,"The provided evidence does not mention Tom Ayrton/Ben Joyce having skills in shipboard medicine, secretly stitching soldiers' wounds, or keeping a mental log. It only describes him as a 'first-rate seaman' and mentions his presence in various situations on board, but does not provide any information that supports the claim about his medical skills or his 'save-yourself-first' instinct."
96,1,"The provided evidence highlights the intense eye contact and non-verbal communication between Noirtier and Valentine, which supports the claim that Noirtier could have developed a method of communication with Valentine through eye movement, evolving into a blink-code after his paralysis."
45,1,"The evidence mentions 'the sight of this slaughter and devastation' which aligns with the claim of 'watching natives slaughtered in a raid' re-awakening Tom Ayrton/Ben Joyce's conscience, suggesting that the claim fits the character's vibe without explicit contradictions."
54,0,"There is no mention of a Chilean doctor named Mariana, her relationship with Thalcave, or her death from nursing cholera-stricken Indians in the provided text, thus the claim is not supported by the evidence."
8,0,"There's no mention of Jacques Paganel being helped by a native tribe, sketching star-maps, or learning tracking techniques and herbal lore in the provided evidence. The text only discusses his map, story, and geographical labors, but does not explicitly support the claim."
32,0,"The provided text does not mention anything about Tom Ayrton/Ben Joyce steering clashes between tribe and settlers toward mutual ruin, or welding survivors into an underground intelligence web. The evidence only confirms that Ayrton and Ben Joyce are the same person, with 'Ben Joyce' being his fighting title, but it lacks any information to support the claimed backstory."
14,0,"The retrieved evidence mentions that Paganel was recognized by a Masonic sign, but it does not mention any mutual recognition with Major McNabbs through hand signs related to living among the Charrúa."
63,1,"No explicit contradiction to the claim, and the context suggests Thalcave's involvement and ability to interact with the group, implying some level of communication, possibly learned through a rescue squad experience."
41,0,"The text describes Tom Ayrton/Ben Joyce as involved in piracy, but does not mention him working with a black-marketeer or smuggling ring in Lisbon, nor does it explicitly mention him evading patrols or feeling guilt over his actions. The text's focus on piracy and the nickname 'Ben Joyce' implies a notorious reputation, but the specifics of the backstory claim are not supported by the provided evidence."
23,0,"The provided evidence does not mention Jacques Paganel's mother, a toddler half-brother, or a French stepfather, which are crucial elements of the backstory claim.

90,0,"The text mentions 'his daughter-in-law' and 'his grandchild', implying Noirtier has a family, but it does not mention a wife named Éloïse or any incident of her drowning. The absence of direct evidence supporting the claim and the existence of a daughter-in-law suggests a contradiction."
100,1,"Although the provided evidence does not explicitly mention Noirtier's early life or his enthusiasm for Voltaire and Rousseau, it does convey a sense of intensity and conviction in his character, as seen in phrases like 'burning with impatience and terror' and 'an almost sublime expression'. This suggests that Noirtier is a passionate individual, which aligns with the idea of him being inspired by the ideologies of liberty and equality, thus supporting the claim."
138,1,"Although there is no direct mention of Faria's family or their financial situation, the text portrays Faria as a noble and high-principled character. The absence of explicit contradiction with the claim suggests that the backstory could fit with the character's overall vibe."
130,1,"The text mentions 'intoxicated', 'delirious', and 'poisonous substance', which implies Faria's system was affected by something harmful, and 'death—because his system is accustomed to that very poison' suggests a build-up of toxins could lead to death, supporting the claim that years of drinking prison water laced with lead could cause sudden death, rather than an epileptic fit."
48,1,"The text mentions Thalcave's name and interactions with settlers, which implies he has adapted to their culture, but it does not explicitly contradict the claim of him guarding his tribe's herb lore and nature beliefs."
